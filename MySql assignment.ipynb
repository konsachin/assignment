    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, stored, and managed in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, updating, and analysis of information. Databases are used in various applications and systems to store and manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems (DBMS) that differ in their data models, query languages, and design philosophies. Here's a brief differentiation between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",

    "\n",
    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to define and manage the structure of a database and its objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) CREATE :- The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects such as tables, views, indexes, or schemas.\n",
    "\n",

    "  EmployeeID INT,\n",
    "  Name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "  Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "2) DROP :- The DROP statement is used to remove database objects from the database. It permanently deletes the specified object and its associated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "      DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "3) ALTER :-  The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It allows you to add, modify, or delete columns, constraints, or indexes.\n",
    "     \n",
    "       ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "ADD Department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4) TRUNCATE :- The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all data from a table while keeping its structure intact. It is faster than using the DELETE statement to remove individual rows because it doesn't generate transaction logs for each deleted row.\n",
    "\n",
    "     TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",

    "DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to manipulate data stored in a database. DML statements are used to insert, update, and delete data within the database tables.\n",

    "\n",
    "Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each record or row in that table. It ensures the uniqueness and integrity of the data in the table. Here are some key points about primary keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Uniqueness: A primary key must have a unique value for each record in the table. No two records can have the same primary key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Non-nullability: A primary key cannot contain a null (empty) value. Each record must have a valid value for the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Single Column or Composite Key: A primary key can consist of a single column or a combination of multiple columns. In the case of a composite key, the combination of column values must be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables based on the values in those columns. Here are some key points about foreign keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Referential Integrity: A foreign key maintains referential integrity by ensuring that the values in the foreign key column(s) correspond to the values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Relationship Establishment: By defining a foreign key relationship, you can establish connections between tables, reflecting dependencies or associations between their data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Parent-Child Relationship: The table containing the primary key is referred to as the parent table, while the table containing the foreign key is referred to as the child table. The foreign key in the child table references the primary key in the parent table.\n"
