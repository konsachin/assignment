    "1). what is multithreading in python? hy is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans :- Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to simultaneously execute multiple threads (smaller units of a program) within a single process. Each thread runs independently, allowing different parts of a program to be executed concurrently. This concurrency can improve the performance and responsiveness of certain types of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used in Python to achieve parallelism, where multiple tasks are executed simultaneously. It is particularly useful in scenarios where there are tasks that can run independently or tasks that involve waiting for external resources, such as input/output operations or network requests. By utilizing multiple threads, the program can continue executing other tasks while waiting for these operations to complete, thus improving overall efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a built-in module called threading to handle threads. The threading module offers a high-level, object-oriented interface for creating and managing threads in Python. It provides functions and classes for creating new threads, synchronizing thread execution, and managing thread behavior. With the threading module, you can create threads, start them, stop them, and coordinate their execution."

    "1.run(): This method is used to define the behavior of a thread when it is executed. It is typically overridden in a subclass of the Thread class.

    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Complexity and Difficult Debugging: Multithreaded programs can be complex to design and debug. Handling shared resources, synchronizing access to shared data, and avoiding race conditions require careful planning and synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or semaphores. Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging due to issues like deadlocks, race conditions, and thread synchronization errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Increased Memory Usage: Each thread within a program requires its own stack space. Consequently, multithreaded programs can consume more memory compared to single-threaded programs, as memory is allocated for each thread's stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Potential Performance Degradation: In some cases, multithreading can lead to performance degradation. This can happen when threads contend for shared resources, leading to increased overhead due to synchronization mechanisms or increased context switching. Additionally, improper thread management or excessive creation of threads can introduce overhead and degrade performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Difficulty in Parallelizing Certain Tasks: Not all tasks can benefit from multithreading. Some tasks are inherently sequential and cannot be easily parallelized. In such cases, multithreading may not provide significant performance gains and can even introduce additional overhead.\n"
