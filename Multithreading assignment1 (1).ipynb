    "1). what is multithreading in python? hy is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans :- Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to simultaneously execute multiple threads (smaller units of a program) within a single process. Each thread runs independently, allowing different parts of a program to be executed concurrently. This concurrency can improve the performance and responsiveness of certain types of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used in Python to achieve parallelism, where multiple tasks are executed simultaneously. It is particularly useful in scenarios where there are tasks that can run independently or tasks that involve waiting for external resources, such as input/output operations or network requests. By utilizing multiple threads, the program can continue executing other tasks while waiting for these operations to complete, thus improving overall efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a built-in module called threading to handle threads. The threading module offers a high-level, object-oriented interface for creating and managing threads in Python. It provides functions and classes for creating new threads, synchronizing thread execution, and managing thread behavior. With the threading module, you can create threads, start them, stop them, and coordinate their execution."

    "1.run(): This method is used to define the behavior of a thread when it is executed. It is typically overridden in a subclass of the Thread class.

    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Complexity and Difficult Debugging: Multithreaded programs can be complex to design and debug. Handling shared resources, synchronizing access to shared data, and avoiding race conditions require careful planning and synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or semaphores. Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging due to issues like deadlocks, race conditions, and thread synchronization errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Increased Memory Usage: Each thread within a program requires its own stack space. Consequently, multithreaded programs can consume more memory compared to single-threaded programs, as memory is allocated for each thread's stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Potential Performance Degradation: In some cases, multithreading can lead to performance degradation. This can happen when threads contend for shared resources, leading to increased overhead due to synchronization mechanisms or increased context switching. Additionally, improper thread management or excessive creation of threads can introduce overhead and degrade performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Difficulty in Parallelizing Certain Tasks: Not all tasks can benefit from multithreading. Some tasks are inherently sequential and cannot be easily parallelized. In such cases, multithreading may not provide significant performance gains and can even introduce additional overhead.\n"

    "Q5. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks and race conditions are two common issues that can occur in multithreaded programs. Let's understand each of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlock:\n",
    "A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources or take some action. In other words, it's a scenario where threads are stuck and cannot proceed further, resulting in a program freeze or deadlock state.\n",
    "Deadlocks typically occur when the following four conditions are met:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual Exclusion: At least one resource must be held in a non-sharable mode, meaning it cannot be simultaneously accessed by multiple threads.\n",
    "Hold and Wait: A thread must hold a resource while waiting to acquire another resource.\n",
    "No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from threads; they can only be released voluntarily.\n",
    "Circular Wait: A circular chain of two or more threads exists, where each thread is waiting for a resource held by another thread in the chain.\n",
    "Deadlocks can be challenging to debug and resolve. They often require careful analysis and design changes to eliminate or prevent them. Proper resource management, avoiding circular wait conditions, and implementing strategies like deadlock detection, prevention, and recovery are crucial for handling deadlocks effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Condition:\n",
    "A race condition occurs when multiple threads access and manipulate shared data concurrently, and the final outcome of the program depends on the order and timing of the thread execution. The result of a race condition is unpredictable and can lead to incorrect or inconsistent behavior.\n",
    "Race conditions can arise when the following conditions are met:\n",
    "\n",
    "Shared Data: Multiple threads access and modify the same shared data or resources.\n",
    "Unsynchronized Access: Threads do not properly synchronize their access to the shared data.\n",
    "Non-Atomic Operations: Operations on shared data are not atomic, meaning they consist of multiple steps that can be interrupted by other threads.\n",
    "When race conditions occur, the execution order of threads may lead to data corruption, inconsistent state, or unexpected outcomes. Examples include situations where one thread reads data while another thread is in the process of updating it, resulting in inconsistent or incorrect values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate race conditions, proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks, semaphores, or atomic operations, should be used to coordinate access to shared resources. Synchronization ensures that only one thread at a time can access or modify the shared data, preventing inconsistent or incorrect behavior.\n",
